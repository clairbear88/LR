# Lesson 2.2: Variables

# Programmers use variables to represent values in their code.
# This makes code easier to read by telling others what values
# mean. It also makes code easier to write by cutting down on
# potentially complicated numbers that repeat in our code.

# We sometimes call numbers without a variable "magic numbers"
# It's best to reduce the amount of "magic numbers" in our code
